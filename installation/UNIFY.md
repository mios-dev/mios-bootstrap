# MiOS — Unified Native Installation + Configuration

**Goal:** one native web-pulled entry (`irm | iex` / `curl | bash`) that pulls everything and hands
into the single guided `mios-install` surface, which both installs *and* opens the MiOS Portal /
configurator — all reading/writing one SSOT. Flatten every redundant elevation / repo-fetch /
prereq-install / toml-resolution / redirector into one shared step.

## Where things are (map)

**Entrypoints (Windows):** `Get-MiOS.ps1` (the `irm|iex` web door, `-Action` router + Default
bootstrap → `bootstrap.ps1` → `build-mios.ps1`), `installation/mios-install.{ps1,sh,bat}` (guided
dispatcher), `cat/MiOS-Cat.bat` (USB flasher/menu hub), `build-mios.ps1` (MiOS-DEV builder).
**Linux:** `build-mios.sh` (canonical), `bootstrap.sh`/`install.sh` (redirectors → build-mios.sh).

**Portal + configurator = one app.** The Portal is routes inside the agent-pipe FastAPI
(`server.py`, `MIOS_PORT_AGENT_PIPE`; `mios-agent-pipe.service`). `mios_pipe/routing/portal.py`
serves `/` (dashboard, embedded `_PORTAL_HTML`), `/configure` (Settings shell), `/portal/configurator`
(iframes on-disk `usr/share/mios/configurator/mios.html`), and `GET/POST /portal/config` (read/write).
`POST /portal/config` writes a **delta to the USER layer** `~/.config/mios/mios.toml` (`kernel/config.py`
`write_user_config`, atomic `os.replace`). `usr/libexec/mios/mios-configurator-launch` probes
`/configure` on the local `agent_pipe` port first, else the offline `~/Downloads/mios-configurator.html`.

**SSOT — 3× mios.toml, layered `vendor < host < user`** (resolver `usr/lib/mios/mios_toml.py`):
- `C:\MiOS\usr\share\mios\mios.toml` — **canonical VENDOR** SSOT (every derived surface + drift-gate reads this).
- `C:\MiOS\mios.toml` — curated root "edit me" subset (drift-gate 48: key-subset of canonical).
- `C:\mios-bootstrap\mios.toml` — Windows/`[cat]`/`[autounattend]` copy (drift-gate 22: `[ports]` parity).

## The redundancy to flatten

| Redundant work | Today | Target |
|---|---|---|
| UAC self-elevate | 4 impls (Get-MiOS, MiOS-Cat.bat, mios-install, build-mios) | ONE shared `Test/Invoke-Elevate` |
| Repo fetch/clone | 6 paths, 2 targets (`M:\MiOS\repo\mios-bootstrap` vs `C:\mios-bootstrap`) | ONE fetch, ONE canonical checkout |
| Prereq install | Get-MiOS (winget), build-mios (WSL/podman), MiOS-Cat (7z), Xbox (DISM) | ONE resolver keyed off the chosen target |
| mios.toml resolve | 5 hand-rolled PS resolvers, different search orders | ONE layered resolver (PS port of `mios_toml.py`) |
| Bootstrap redirectors | `bootstrap.ps1`, `install.ps1`, `bootstrap.sh`, `install.sh` all → build-mios | collapse to ONE canonical entry per OS |
| Guided menus | `mios-install` catalog **and** MiOS-Cat.bat menu; MiOS-Cat.bat even re-runs `irm Get-MiOS\|iex` (a loop back to the web door) | `mios-install` is the ONLY guided surface; MiOS-Cat.bat becomes the **flash executor only** |

## Target flow

```
irm .../mios | iex   (Windows)   /   curl .../mios | bash   (Linux)
  └─ ONE bootstrap, shared steps EXACTLY ONCE:
       agreement → elevate → repo-fetch → prereq(target) → SSOT-resolve
  └─ hands into  installation/mios-install.{ps1,sh}   (the single guided surface)
       flash/live → cat/MiOS-Cat.bat   (flash executor only; no self-update, no web re-entry)
       oci/build  → build-mios.{ps1,sh}
       xbox       → cat/autounattend/*.ps1
       configure  → Portal/configurator @ /configure on the agent_pipe port   (the one SSOT editor)
```

## Reaching the guided surface from the web door

```powershell
# Guided menu (fetch repo, then the SSOT-themed installer that explains every target):
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mios-dev/mios-bootstrap/main/Get-MiOS.ps1))) -Action Install
# Straight to the one SSOT editor (MiOS Portal / configurator):
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mios-dev/mios-bootstrap/main/Get-MiOS.ps1))) -Action Configure
```

Both fetch the repo (git, else GitHub zip) exactly once, then hand into
`installation\mios-install.ps1` — no launch logic re-implemented in the web door.
`Default` (the bare `irm | iex`) still runs the full Pass-1/Pass-2 bootstrap unchanged.

## Steps (incremental; each keeps things working)

1. **[DONE] `configure` target in `mios-install`** — the guided installer now opens the Portal /
   configurator (`/configure` on the `agent_pipe` port, else MiOS-DEV launcher, else offline HTML). One surface for
   install **and** config.
2. **[DONE] Shared `installation/mios-common.ps1` + `.sh`** — the ONE contract: layered SSOT
   resolver (`Get-MiosSsotValue` / `mios_ssot_value`, `user > host > vendor`, same order as
   `mios_toml.py`), SSOT-`[colors]` themed console/logger, `Test/Invoke-Elevate` +
   `mios_self_elevate`, and `Ensure-MiosRepo` / `mios_ensure_repo`. Both `mios-install.ps1` and
   `mios-install.sh` now source it and keep only their guided/dispatch surface (the two files each
   shed ~40 lines of duplicated theme/elevation/resolver code). Verified: parse + all-target
   dry-runs green in pwsh7 + WPS5.1 + Git-Bash. **Next:** migrate `Get-MiOS.ps1`, `build-mios.{ps1,sh}`,
   and `MiOS-Cat.bat` to source the same contract (one at a time, each re-tested).
3. **[DONE] Break the web-door loop in `MiOS-Cat.bat`** — `:build_need_online` no longer runs
   `irm Get-MiOS|iex` (a re-entry back through the web door, which redoes agreement/elevation/prereqs
   and, since Get-MiOS often launches MiOS-Cat, was circular). It now fetches the mios-bootstrap repo
   ONCE (git, else GitHub zip — the same logic as `Ensure-MiosRepo`, inlined because the repo is
   exactly what's missing) into `C:\mios-bootstrap`, then hands into the LOCAL `build-mios.ps1`.
   Embedded PS parse-checked (0 errors). *Deliberately kept:* the startup self-update (only acts on a
   dev checkout — `cd C:\MiOS` / `C:\mios-bootstrap` fail on the USB, so it is a no-op there) and the
   explicit user-invoked "Update repos" menu item (not an auto-loop).
4. **[DONE — already satisfied] Redirectors are thin aliases.** Audited all four:
   `install.ps1` (46L) → `bootstrap.ps1`; `bootstrap.ps1` (103L) → `build-mios.ps1 -BootstrapOnly`
   (else fetches `Get-MiOS.ps1`); `install.sh` (17L) → `build-mios.sh`; `bootstrap.sh` (51L) →
   `build-mios.sh` (else fetches it). All are pure arg-forwarders with retry/validation — no
   duplicated business logic. They exist **specifically** to keep the documented legacy one-liners
   (`irm .../install.ps1|iex`, `curl .../install.sh|bash`) working, so deleting them would be a
   regression, not a flatten. Left as-is. (The one asymmetry — Windows has the extra `bootstrap.ps1`
   hop — is load-bearing: it sets the `-BootstrapOnly` default and carries the `Get-MiOS.ps1`
   WT-staging/elevation/M:\ fallback that the Linux side folds into `build-mios.sh`.)
5. **One canonical checkout path** — the shared contract already standardizes on `C:\mios-bootstrap`
   (`Ensure-MiosRepo` / `mios_ensure_repo` and MiOS-Cat's fetch-once all target it). `Get-MiOS.ps1`'s
   `$RepoDir = M:\MiOS\repo\mios-bootstrap` default (its heavy Pass-1/Pass-2 build tree) is a
   *separate* build-workspace concern from the installer checkout — retiring/aligning it is a
   `build-mios.ps1` change, tracked separately so it doesn't destabilize the working build path.

6. **[DONE] SSOT consolidation via `mios-sync-toml`.** Landed the projector (sibling of
   `mios-sync-theme`) at `C:\MiOS\usr\libexec\mios\mios-sync-toml`: it regenerates the drift-prone
   PROJECTED sections — `[ports]` and `[colors]` — **verbatim** from the canonical vendor SSOT
   (`usr/share/mios/mios.toml`) into both derived copies (`C:\MiOS\mios.toml` and
   `C:\mios-bootstrap\mios.toml`), never touching owned content (`[autounattend]`/`[smoke_tests]`/
   `[mios_app]`, the gate-48 `ignored_prefixes`, and the copies' own `[ports.lan_firewall]`). Supports
   `--check`. Enforcement: new **drift-gate 62** `check_toml_projection` in
   `automation/38-drift-checks.sh` (+ a `test_toml_projection` negative test), complementing gate 22
   (bootstrap `[ports]` value parity) and gate 48 (root key-subset) with a whole-block projection
   check. Validated with real python/tomllib: tool idempotent; gates 22/48/62 green; negative test
   passes; no key drops. Both the bootstrap `[colors]` projection and the `C:\MiOS` tool+gate
   (`8682bd80`) are pushed.
   *Extending coverage:* add a section name to `PROJECTED` in the tool only after confirming
   canonical ⊇ derived for it (so a projection can never drop a key a consumer reads). Portal keeps
   writing only the user layer; nothing is hand-maintained across three copies any more.

## Repo mirror (Law 15)

`mios.git` is the authority for every surface both repos share. `mios.toml`
`[bootstrap.sync].mirror_files` names them; `tools/sync-bootstrap.py --check` is
the drift gate and `--apply` is what CI runs after a green build, so the mirror
is mechanical rather than a habit someone remembers.

Only listed files are touched. What the two repos legitimately own differently
is enumerated in `not_mirrored` so the divergence reads as deliberate rather
than as drift someone forgot to fix: the entry points (`install.sh` redirects to
`build-mios.sh` here because this repo root IS the system root, while bootstrap
redirects to `cat/MiOS-Cat.sh`, which exists only there), `mios-common.sh`
(identical code, richer comments in bootstrap that are not yet harvested), each
repo's agent instructions, and `.gitignore`.
